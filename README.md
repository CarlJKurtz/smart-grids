# SmartGrids

SmartGrids is a small, free application that allows you to easily configure and preview typography grids.
You can input parameters like the page size, margins, font size, and leading, SmartGrids will then show you possible grid configurations.

Unlike the built-in grid creation tools in Adobe InDesign, the grids will automatically be aligned to your body copy. The gridlines can be aligned with the Cap-Height, Ascender, or x-Height of the text. It also allows for a baseline shift so that the gridlines don't align with the baseline of the text but with the descenders.

Creating Cap-Height aligned grids in Adobe Indesign was not impossible, but always involved lots of trial and error. The applications allow you to skip the tedious guesswork and manual calculations. SmartGrids will show you all possible grid configurations and output all relevant values which you can then input into your layout software.

The grids follow the style proposed by Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockamann in his influential 1981 book [Grid Systems in Graphic Design](https://books.google.de/books/about/Grid_Systems_in_Graphic_Design_a_Visual.html?id=YOgtwAEACAAJ&redir_esc=y). Typographic grids help you structure your layouts in a meaningful and clean way. When working on larger editorial projects they can speed up your workflow significantly.
